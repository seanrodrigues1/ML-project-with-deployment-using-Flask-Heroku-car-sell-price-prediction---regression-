STEPS TO DEPLOY MODEL USING FLASK WEB FRAMEWORK AND HEROKU PLATFORM:

1.CREATE A NEW ENVIRONMENT IN ANACONDA

2.OPEN JUPYTER NOTEBOOK , IMPORT DATASET, PREPROCESS DATA, EDA, RUN DIFFERENT MODELS AND CHECK PERFORMANCE. FINALLY SAVE THE BEST MODEL IN A    
  PICKLE FILE IN THE SAME WORKING DIRECTORY

3.OPEN SYPDER OR ANY OTHER IDE, CREATE HTML FILE (INDEX.HTML) AND CREATE YOUR FRONT END WEBPAGE. THIS CAN BE A FORM TAKING IN INFORMATION  FROM THE USER TO AND DIVERTING IT TO A ANOTHER WEBPAGE WHERE PROCESSING IS DONE AND YOUR MODEL IS USED .THIS INDEX.HTML NEEDS TO BE PUT INSIDE A templates FOLDER OR A MANUALLY CREATED TEMPLATES FOLDER



4.CREATE A app.py PYTHON FILE ,IMPORT THE NECESSARY FLASK FRAME WORK LIBRARIES , LOAD THE MODEL(PICKLE FILE CREATED EARLIER) AND RUN THE  MODEL USING THE DATA RETRIEVED FROM INDEX.HTML


5. CREATE A REQUIREMENTS.TXT FILE (USING pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt , ALSO DO NOT FORGET TO ADD gunicorn IN THE REQUIREMENTS FILE

5.ALL OUR FILES SHOULD IDEALLY RESIDE IN THE SAME PROJECT DIRECTORY (MODEL.PICKLE,APP.PY,TEMPLATES,DATA SET,REQUIREMENTS.TXT AND A PROCFILE.TXT WHICH SHOULD HAVE web: gunicorn app:app INSIDE IT )

6.SAVE THESE FILES TO YOUR GITHUB REPO

7.CREATE A NEW APP IN HEROKU PLATFORM AND DEPLOY YOUR MODEL. YOU HAVE TO PUSH THIS REPO.
